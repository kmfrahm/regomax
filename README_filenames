Signification of output data files:
-----------------------------------

1) G-matrix files for different variants of reduced Google matrix
with extension G*.dat


(i) Name format: GXX_NETWORK_GROUPNAME_Nr.dat

with XX=I, pr, qr, R, rr, rrplusGqr for 6 G-matrix variants (see below in 
(iii) for explanations).

NETWORK = name of used basis network, e.g. testnet for the example network 
provided here 

GROUPNAME = name of group of nodes used, e.g. testgroup for the testgroup 
files provided here

Nr = matrix dimension (of the reduced Google matrices), e.g. 40 for testgroup

(ii) Content format: 
There are 5 columns with each line representing one matrix element G(i,j)
The columns are: i, j, value of G(i,j), name of node i, name of node j
(the two name columns are optionnal and only present if a testgroup.name 
file is provided, "names" may contain spaces) all separated by 
tab-symbols ("\t" in C) and eventual additional spaces. Due to the 
tab-symbols one can access a column "p" (p=1,2,3,4 or 5) by the command:
cut GXX_NETWORK_GROUPNAME_Nr.dat -f p
The index j is moving faster with line number of file. The blocks 
corresponding to one value of i ("one matrix row") are separated by an 
empty line.

(iii) Signification of different G-matrix variants:

The names GR etc. correspond (mostly) to the definitions of the paper:
Eur. Phys. J. B (2016) 89: 269, see also: arXiv:1609.01948 [cs.SI] (2016).

in detail:
Grr is defined as the 11-Block of eq. (3) of the above paper and 
  corresponds to the direct links inside the group of nodes. 
GR is the full reduced Google matrix given by eqs. (8) and (16). 
Gpr is the main projector part given by eq. (17).
Gqr is the given by eq. (18).
GI = Gpr + Gqr is the full "indirect" or Interaction contribution, also given 
  by the second term of second equation in (8).
GrrplusGqr is the renormalized effective Google matrix obtained from the 
  sum of Grr and Gqr but only using non-diagonal terms of Gqr (the large 
  diagonal elements of Gqr are not taken into account here). Eventual negative 
  elements are made positive and afterwards the columns are sum normalized 
  such that GrrplusGqr will have the symmetries of a Google matrix.


2) Gmatrix files with extensions G*.mat:

(i) Name format: GXX_NETWORK_GROUPNAME_Nr.mat
similar as above.

(ii) Content format: 
1st line: => Nr^2
2nd line: => Nr
further lines all matrix elements G(i,j)
with i=1,...,Nr outer loop and j=1,...,Nr inner loop 
(i.e. Nr lines in file for first row of G, than Nr lines for second row etc.).

These files are typically used as input for other programs, e.g. 
to create density plot files etc.


3) pagerank files: 

(i) Name fomat: pagerank_YYYY_GROUPNAME_NETWORK_ALPHA.dat
with GROUPNAME and NETWORK as above, ALPHA=0.15 = 1-damping factor 
with damping factor = 0.85).
YYYY corresponds to:
"full" => full PageRank vector of the NETWORK
"left" => left eigenvector of G_{ss} (see page 4, first column, last paragraph 
	of above paper for explanations).
"right" => right eigenvector of G_{ss}; note that the latter two were crucial 
	to compute GR etc. according to eqs. (12) to (18).
"small" => the PageRank vector of the reduced Google matrix GR
"GrrplusGqr" => the PageRank vector of the effective Google matrix GrrplusGqr
	as explained above, the latter two were directly computed by the 
	powermethod using the small reduced matrices

(ii) Content format:
first line: "# size =    <size_of_vector>
further lines: three columns and the lines are ordered 
according to K-index of each vector (i.e. first line => largest value 
of vector etc.).
1st column = K-index (note in the file K-index starts with 0 and 
  not 1), 
2nd column = the value of the vector
3rd column = original node index (also starting with 0)

In order to limit file size for larger networks only the first 10000 
elements are shown completed. Above 10000 only 100 values (in constant 
density in log-representation) are shown per "factor of 10", i.e. 100 values 
between 10^4 and 10^5, further 100 values between 10^5 and 10^6 etc.
Here the value of 10000 correspond to the input parameter "print_number" and 
100 to "ten_number" in net_greduced.cc and both values are the default values 
used in the run*.sh scripts.

Note these files do not contain tab symbols (since there are only numbers and 
no text parts with spaces). All columns are separated by spaces.


4) subpagerank files

(i) Name format: similar as above but name starting with "subpagerank" 
instead of "pagerank"

(ii) Content format: These file give the different (pagerank and other) 
vectors but only in the small space of reduced nodes with 6 columns which 
ares explained in second lines of each each file:
# reduced index, value, normalized value, original index, K index, name
For the three cases full, left and right the normalization changes from big 
to small network. For left and right the shown vectors are not \psi_L/R 
(which are actually "0" on reduced nodes !) but the related vectors 
in small space given by 
a=G_{rs}\psi_R and b=G_{sr}^T\psi_L such that G_{pr}=ab^T 
according to eq. (17) of above paper. Here G_{rs} and G_{sr} are the 
12 and 21 blocks in (3).
For small and GrrplusGqr "small" and "big" space are the same (i.e. only 
"small" space).


5) INPUT* and OUTPUT* 
input and output files used by the scripts "run*.sh". The OUTPUT* files also 
contain information about the leading eigenvalue lambda_c of G_{ss} (typically 
very close to unity) for the left and right eigenvectors \psi_L,R. Simply 
use the command: "grep lambda OUTPUT*" to obtain the corresponding value(s).
Note that lambda_c is calculated twice during the computation of \psi_L and 
\psi_R. For technical reasons the computation by \psi_R is more precise (due 
to direct computation of 1-\lambda_c<<1). 
The output of "grep lambda OUTPUT*" also provides the small numerical 
difference betwenn both values.
